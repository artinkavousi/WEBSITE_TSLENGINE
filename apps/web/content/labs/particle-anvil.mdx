seoDescription: "Prototype visual scripting flows and render pass orchestration inside the Particle Anvil lab for Website v1.1."
---

## Overview

Particle Anvil demonstrates how the Website v1.1 control tower streamlines emitter orchestration.
Teams can drag nodes, animate parameters on the collaborative timeline, and view render passes in
parallel while the AI assistant suggests presets gathered from partner deployments.

```tsx
const anvil = engine.modules.create("particle-emitters", {
  preset: "particle-emitters/v3",
  timeline: "collaborative",
});

anvil.timeline.scrub(42);
anvil.renderPasses.attach("deferred");
```

## Rituals

- **Timeline retrospectives** — annotate emitter decisions with enablement templates for faster onboarding.
- **Render audits** — compare forward and deferred passes while the observability spine tracks budget drift.
- **AI pairing** — ask the copilot for parameter nudges sourced from previous lab experiments.

## Field Notes

The lab pushes the runtime's streaming material compiler, so expect the roadmap to highlight ongoing
work on GPU memory compaction and AI-led preset hygiene for large emitter libraries.

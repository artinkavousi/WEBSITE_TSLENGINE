# Post-Processing Effects

Transform your scenes with powerful post-processing.

## Essential Effects

### Bloom
Adds glow to bright areas:
```typescript
bloom: {
  strength: 0.8,
  radius: 0.4,
  threshold: 0.85
}
```

### Depth of Field
Simulates camera focus:
```typescript
dof: {
  focusDistance: 5.0,
  focalLength: 0.1,
  bokehScale: 2.0
}
```

### Color Grading
Artistic color control:
```typescript
colorGrading: {
  exposure: 1.0,
  contrast: 1.1,
  saturation: 1.2
}
```

Make your scenes cinematic! 🎬

## Overview

Spectral Nodes prototypes the annotation-powered composer described in the roadmap. Connect live
inputs, blend spectral curves, and capture presets that sync back to the enablement repository. The
annotation stream is rendered directly from MDX content so designers can embed code snippets and
observability callouts without leaving the lab.

```tsx
<AnalyzerPanel
  source="labs/spectral"
  inspectors={["sine", "pulse", "saw"]}
  annotations={annotationStream}
/>
```

## Rituals

- **Live collaboration** — every node edit emits diff payloads that the Builder Agent can translate into PRs.
- **Preset curation** — maintain versioned banks of tone-mapping curves and share them with partner teams.
- **Research lineage** — store waveform experiments with rich MDX annotations to maintain audit trails.

## Field Notes

The composer leans on the runtime's optimistic concurrency controls to keep multiple contributors in
sync. When conflicts do occur, the AI assistant suggests merge strategies by replaying MDX snippets
from similar labs and compliance reviews.

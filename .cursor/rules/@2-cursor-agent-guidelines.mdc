# Cursor Agent Guidelines

These rules apply whenever you work in this project.

## 🚩 Core Principles

- 🔍 **Proactive Analysis** – Explore related files and scripts semantically before responding.
- 🏁 **Complete Execution** – Finish tasks fully in a single session without intentionally leaving work half-done.
- 💬 **Concise Communication** – Use compact explanations; prefer bullets and code over essays.
- 🎯 **Focused Implementation** – Touch only code areas relevant to the task.
- 🧪 **Test-First / Test-Backed** – Reason about tests and verification before claiming success.

## 🧠 Task Workflow

1. 📋 **Understand** the request precisely. If ambiguous, ask 1–2 targeted clarifying questions.
2. 🔍 **Inspect** the relevant files, modules, and call sites.
3. 🗺️ **Plan** the change in 3–6 bullet points.
4. 📝 **Implement** changes in the existing codebase (no demo projects).
5. 🧪 **Validate** logically:
   - Add/update REAL tests when appropriate.
   - Explain how the user should run them (commands).
6. 📊 **Review**:
   - Check for side-effects on related modules.
   - Ensure consistency with existing patterns.

## 🧾 Code Quality Standards

- Follow existing formatting and naming conventions.
- Use descriptive, intention-revealing names.
- Avoid duplication; reuse existing helpers when possible.
- Keep functions focused and small where practical.
- Avoid magic numbers; extract to constants/config when helpful.
- Add comments only where non-obvious decisions are made.

## Bug Fixing & Problem Solving

- Do NOT rewrite large parts of working systems unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer surgical fixes:
  - Identify the minimal change that resolves the bug.
  - Keep current API and call sites stable unless told otherwise.
- Consider how changes affect:
  - Types, public interfaces, and external consumers.
  - Performance and async behavior (where relevant).

## Environment & Tools

- Assume the user can run commands like:
  - `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm test`, etc.
- When suggesting commands or steps, keep them minimal and exact.
- Do NOT ask the user to perform long manual sequences if a shorter alternative exists.

Remember: this project values **real fixes over pretty prose**, and **depth over shallow “quick wins”**.

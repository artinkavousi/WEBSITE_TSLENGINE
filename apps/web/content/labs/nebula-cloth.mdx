## Overview

The Nebula Cloth lab lifts the guardrails described in the control tower playbooks to show how the
Website v1.1 canvas manages high-frequency constraint solving without losing composability. The
preset loads a pre-authored lattice with configurable anchors so you can play through different
materials while the engine continues to stream telemetry into the ops HUD.

```ts
const cloth = engine.modules.create("cloth-solver", {
  preset: "cloth-solver/v1",
  damping: 0.18,
  iterations: 24,
});

cloth.applyWindField({
  tunnel: "research",
  strength: 1.4,
  turbulence: 0.62,
});
```

## Rituals

- **Preset hand-off** — swap in art-direction presets while the live solver keeps its cache intact.
- **Runtime inspection** — pipe solver metrics to the control panel widget for immediate validation.
- **Export workflow** — trigger GLTF snapshots with constraint metadata for downstream review.

## Field Notes

The lattice viewer is wired to the observability spine so artists can bookmark interesting frames.
Each bookmark attaches the active module preset, wind field, and performance metrics to support
compliance evidence when the lab graduates into production.

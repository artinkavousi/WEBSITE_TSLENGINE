# WEBSITE v1.1 — TSL Kit WebGPU Engine-First Website Initiative

This project captures the implementation plan for building the Website v1.1 platform by
adapting the guidance from the **TSL‑KIT WebGPU Engine & Engine‑First Website — Comprehensive Architecture & Implementation Guide (r180+)** and the **TSL/WebGPU Engine + Website — Final Unified Proposal v2.0**.

The initiative is organised into four sequential phases so that each milestone delivers a fully
functioning slice of the system before progressing to the next stage. Supporting documents in
this folder provide detailed tasks, research references, deliverables, and acceptance criteria for
each phase.

## Source Material
- `TSLENGINE/proposal4/WEBSITEv1.1tsl_kit_web_gpu_engine_engine_first_website_comprehensive_architecture_implementation_guide_r_181.md`
- `TSLENGINE/proposalchat.md`

## Folder Contents
- `PHASE_PLAN.md` — overview of the four phases and cross-cutting concerns.
- `phase-01-prep.md` — research, knowledge acquisition, and repository preparation work.
- `phase-02-core-engine.md` — skeleton application, engine package scaffolding, and minimal WebGPU pipeline.
- `phase-03-extensions.md` — advanced engine features, module catalogue build-out, and supporting tooling.
- `phase-04-website.md` — content pipeline, UI/UX overlays, auxiliary pages, and AI assistants.
- `CHECKLISTS.md` — consolidated acceptance tests, QA criteria, and go/no-go gates per phase.
- `RISKS.md` — identified risks, dependencies, and mitigation strategies.

Each document is intended to be living; update the plans as discovery work refines scope or new
requirements emerge.

# Documentation Creation Policy

## ❌ DO NOT Create Documentation For:
- Minor bug fixes or small changes
- Routine code edits or refactoring
- Temporary experiments or tests
- Work-in-progress states
- Individual function implementations
- Every single step of a process
- Intermediate states during development
- Simple code additions or deletions

## ✅ ONLY Create Documentation When:

### 1. Major Phase Completion
- Full feature implementation completed and tested
- Major architectural changes finished
- Complete migration or upgrade done
- Entire system/module ready for production

### 2. Critical Lessons Learned
- Debugging complex issues that took significant effort
- Non-obvious solutions to difficult problems
- Important gotchas or edge cases discovered
- Performance optimization insights

### 3. Project Milestones
- Version releases (v1.0, v2.0, etc.)
- Production deployment notes
- Breaking changes that require migration guides

### 4. Explicitly Requested
- User specifically asks for documentation
- Required for handoff or team collaboration

## Documentation Format Requirements (When Allowed)

When documentation IS necessary:

### Keep It Concise
- Maximum ~50–100 lines for most docs
- Use bullet points over long paragraphs
- Focus on "what changed" and "why it matters"
- Skip obvious information

### Structure
```markdown
# [Brief Title]

## What Was Done
- Key change 1
- Key change 2

## Important Notes
- Critical gotcha or lesson learned
- Performance/security consideration (if any)

## Next Steps (if applicable)
- What remains to be done
```

## Token & Noise Reduction

- Prefer **code comments** over separate documentation files.
- **Update existing docs** instead of creating new ones.
- Do **not** create multiple tiny docs; consolidate into one summary when needed.
- Default: **Write code, add comments, move forward.**
